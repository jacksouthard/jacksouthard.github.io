## What I Learned
Fish schooling behavior and dynamic net generation.

## Description

Bycatch is a simple app made as part of a summer project at COSMOS on the bycatch of countless animals when fishing. Drag to create your net and catch all the fish while avoiding the bycatch. I wanted to make my project stand out among the others so I decided to publish an educational app over the span of a couple weeks.

Bycatch is all the wasted and discarded catch from commercial fishies. It often occurs when fishies use nonselective nets which can span miles in the ocean, entangling whatever animal that touches them. It is a huge problem as bycatch makes up an estimated 40% of the worlds fishery catch and has the potential to destroy entire ecosystems.
