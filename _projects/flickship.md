## What I Learned
Turn based multiplayer with online matchmaking, procedurally generating asteroids, and dynamic vision based on ship line of sight.

## Description

Flickship is a turn based online multiplayer game in which two players fight head to head on in procedurally generated astroid field. A unique vision system forces players to scout and gather intelligence before making their attack. Use a variety of different ships, each with its own specialties to outplay your opponent.
