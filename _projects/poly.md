## What I Learned
Single server realtime multiplayer with complicated player interactions, player state serialization to sync the characters attached parts and shape, and advanced AI behavior.

## Description

I always wanted to make a multiplayer game, but was frustrated with its complexity. However, after three failed attempts, I was able to complete Poly, an online multiplayer game supporting up to 15 players or AI. It draws heavy influence from the geometry class I was taking when I original game up with the idea. Collect segments to increase your geometric mass and augment your poly with a variety of parts. Fight other players to rack up kills and get on the realtime leaderboard.
