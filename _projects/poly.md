## What I Learned
Single server realtime multiplayer with complicated player interactions, player state serialization to sync the characters attached parts and shape, and advanced AI behavior.

## Description

Poly is an online multiplayer game currently having up to 15 players or AI on a single server. Collect segments to increase your geometric mass and augment your poly with a variety of parts. Fight other players to rack up kills and get on the realtime leaderboard.
