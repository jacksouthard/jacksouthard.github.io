## Description

Your ship is out of fuel and the space police are right on your tail! Use your trusty chain and swing your way through the asteroid field to survive as long as possible. My friend Nathan and I challenged each other to a week-long competition to see who could remake one of his old games better. Our friends judged and could not pick a winner, but ill let you decide.
