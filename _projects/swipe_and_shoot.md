## What I Learned
Low poly art in Blender, coding complex vehicle behavior, and creating a system for level creation, level objectives, cutscenes, and progress saving.

## Description

Swipe and Shoot is a unique iOS game centered around launching your cartoonish soldier into battle in an unlikely effort to save the world from nuclear winter. Made as a remastered version of Swipe and Shoot, we hoped to address the issues with the previous game and fully express our vision for the game.
