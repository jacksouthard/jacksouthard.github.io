		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my website. Below are a collection of my various projects that I have worked on throughout high school, ranging from a couple days to a couple months in length.
			 All projects are made in the Unity Engine and the coding is done in C#. Currently, I have three apps on the App Store, two of them being collaberations with a partner. Tap to expand a project and learn more.</p>
